      # 2) Use dorny/paths-filter to detect changes to package.json or yarn.lock

          # The cache key automatically uses the contents of package.json + yarn.lock,
          # so when those haven’t changed, yarn install will restore from cache.

      #    else guard this too if, for example, only code changes should trigger a build)
